# ML-Project---Real-Estate-Price-Prediction

**About The Project**

This project aims to predict house prices based on various features such as the number of convinience store , distance from nearest MRT station.
In the real estate market, predicting property prices is crucial for both buyers and sellers. 
This project builds a predictive model using Linear Regression to estimate the price of a house based on various independent features.
It is a regression problem, and the model was evaluated using common error metrics.
